The talks were as diverse as the background of the speakers themselves,
but there was one common thread: In this era of rapid change, are we, as
product people, equipped to design for automation, machine learning, and
AI?

## What does automation mean for designers?

It’s hard to work on a product team that hasn’t automated some part of
their workflow in the name of productivity. If machines can take care of
the repeatable tasks and heavy lifting, designers can focus on doing
more meaningful work. But how does this affect the way we use the work
being created by machines?

founder of design studio Big Medium, provoked the audience with this
very question during his talk,
‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaEqYgZgrUc" class="A-bsbdoj-0 egcoWJ">A.I. is your New Design Material</a>’.
Some of the most impressive advancements in recent technology are things
like facial recognition, predictive text, and image search, all powered
by machine learning. But it’s important to remember – all of these
technologies are still built on code. The upside is less room for error.
No real emotions, expectations, or feelings get in the way of the job it
was designed to do.

Yet, as humans, we assume that when facial recognition fails, the whole
process is inherently flawed. But was it really?
